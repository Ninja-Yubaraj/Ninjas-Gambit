# TODOs:
- Bug Fix:
    - ~~both capture and check sound plays, when caputuring a piece with check.~~
- UI Changes:
    - change Orientation(Center big rectangle, 70% board, 30% Dashboard).
    - Dashboard should have:
        - Moves history
        - Buttons
        - A console for some text and output.
    - add new buttons(Beginning, Back, Forward, Ending, Replay)
    - Selected Square should be f5f682 and last moved piece square should be b9ca43.
    - Available moves should have a small shadow circle, with captures a shadow circle around them.
    - Checked king should have a red circular shadow around and remove flashes.
